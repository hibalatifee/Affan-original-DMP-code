# Affan-original-DMP-code
TUM's Affan's original code on Matlab, with demonstrations 
This was given to me by Affan at the beginning of the year 2018. Even though this is working standalone, this was not givng me the right output when
integrated with my World Haptics paper setup (to and fro communication between C++ and Matlab). 
The demos in this project were given by Affan himself. Just change the folder path for the demos in the Matlab code when running it.
